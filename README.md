# Energy Consumption Analysis and Forecasting

This project undertakes a comprehensive analysis and forecasting of hourly energy consumption data from PJM Interconnection LLC. Leveraging a variety of data science tools, software integrations, and specialized techniques, we aim to uncover key trends, seasonal patterns, and ultimately predict future energy demand. Integrating technical tools like Tableau for better trend insight

## Project Overview

The primary objective of this project is to provide in-depth business insights from historical energy consumption data. We focus on:

*   **Data Cleaning and Preparation:** Ensuring data quality and handling missing values for reliable analysis.
*   **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Identifying initial patterns and correlations within the dataset.
*   **Time Series Decomposition:** Breaking down the data into trend, seasonality, and residual components to understand underlying structures.
*   **Forecasting:** Building and evaluating a time-series model to predict future energy consumption.

## Data Science Tools Utilized

This project employs several powerful libraries from the Python data science ecosystem:

*   **Tableau:** For visualization and dynamic filters.
*   **Pandas:** Used extensively for data manipulation, cleaning, and initial exploration. Its data structures (DataFrames) and functions are crucial for handling the time-series data.
*   **NumPy:** Provides support for numerical operations and array manipulation, complementing Pandas.
*   **Matplotlib & Plotly:** Utilized for creating static and interactive visualizations to better understand data patterns and trends.
*   **ydata-profiling:** A valuable tool for generating detailed and interactive EDA reports quickly, providing a high-level overview of the dataset's characteristics.
*   **Prophet:** A forecasting library developed by Facebook. It's specifically designed for time-series data that has strong seasonal effects and historical holidays.

## Software Integration: Tableau for Enhanced EDA

While Python provides robust analytical capabilities, **Tableau** was integrated into the exploratory data analysis phase to offer a more interactive and visually rich environment for discovering insights. Tableau dashboards allowed for dynamic exploration of the data, enabling the identification of patterns and anomalies that might be less apparent in static plots. This integration provided a powerful complement to the programmatic EDA performed with Pandas.

## Isolating Seasonal Data

A significant aspect of this project involved understanding and isolating the seasonal components of the energy consumption data. Energy demand is heavily influenced by time-based factors such as hour of day, day of week, week of year, and season. By extracting these time-based features and visualizing their relationship with demand, we were able to clearly identify conditional and multiple seasonalities. Decomposing the time series further helped to separate the cyclical patterns from the overall trend and random noise, providing a clearer picture of the recurring influences on energy consumption. This isolation was crucial for building an effective forecasting model.

## Forecasting with Prophet

The **Prophet** library was chosen for the time series forecasting component of this project. Prophet is well-suited for this dataset due to its ability to handle:

*   **Trends:** Automatically detects changes in the data's overall direction.
*   **Multiple Seasonalities:** Easily incorporates daily, weekly, and yearly patterns.
*   **Robustness:** Handles missing data and outliers effectively, which is common in real-world time series.

Prophet's additive model structure makes it easier to interpret the individual components of the forecast, providing valuable insights into the drivers of predicted energy demand.

## Conclusion

Through a combination of robust data science tools, strategic software integration for visualization, and specialized techniques for understanding seasonality, this project provides a detailed analysis and a reliable forecasting model for hourly energy consumption. The insights gained can inform decision-making related to resource allocation, grid management, and capacity planning for PJM Interconnection LLC.

Further work could explore additional exogenous variables (like weather data) and potentially compare Prophet's performance against other time series forecasting methods.
